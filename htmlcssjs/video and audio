Build an HTML Audio and Video Player
Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

You should have an h1 element for the main title of the page.
You should have two section elements.
Inside the first section element, you should have an h2 element for the title of the video playing.
Below the h2 element, you should have a video element with controls and width attributes. The width attribute should be set to 640.
Inside the video element, you should have a source element with a src attribute pointing to a video file and a type attribute.
You can use https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/What is the map method and how does it work.mp4.
Inside the second section element, you should have an h2 element for the title of the song playing.
Below the h2 element, you should have an audio element with the controls and loop attributes, and a src attribute that points to an audio file.
